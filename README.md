# HirstPainting
- Input a web image url into the program and watch the program generate a Damien Hirst Dot painting using the colors from the original image. 
- Tweak the number of colors that you want to extract from the initial image.
- Generates a pie chart of the most prominent colors in the image (as well as their hexcode). The pie chart only includes the number of colors you select.
